        <p class="dropcap">A good lengthy times past and after more years than you can imagine in war, famine and witnessing many escaping the punishment they deserve, founder Ben Smith – later known as Sir Benjamin – took the first commercial executioner course offered in a nearby town and found the result exhilarating. The post-execution gave Sir Benjamin a satisfied feeling of justice that was so close to what he’d been searching for many, many years that it seemed obvious that tortures time had come.</p>

        <p>Since its founding, <strong><em>Third Degree Inc.</em></strong> and its people have helped redefine the meaning of torture devices. The company has continually broken new ground in torture devices and in providing new opportunities for medieval fanatics. In truth, the success of our devices is dependent on the feedback from medieval fanatics who are asked to try products and provide their insights.</p>

        <h2>Naming the Company</h2>
        <p><strong><em>The Third Degree Inc.</em></strong> name was chosen in a survey of close family and friends along with the occasional acquaintances from a list of 16 names and 5 logos. The logo that won and stuck is the above.</p>
